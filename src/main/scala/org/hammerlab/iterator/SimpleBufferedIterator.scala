/**
 * Interface for implementing [[BufferedIterator]]s following a common pattern: the `hasNext` implementation must
 * actually compute the next element (or return a sentinel that implies that one doesn't exist), and should therefore
 * cache that element to serve `head` and `next()` calls.
 *
 * This interface allows subclasses to simply implement an `_advance` method that returns an [[Option]] containing the
 * next element, if one exists, and [[None]] otherwise, and it takes care of the rest of the boilerplate.
 *
 * It also exposes protected `clear` and `postNext` methods for [[None]]ing the internal state and responding to
 * `next()` having been called, respectively.
